# Git and GitHub

## Git
Git is a Version Control System.  
A version control system is a software that tracks and manages changes to files over time.  
Version Control Systems allow users to revisit earlier versions of their files, compare changes between versions, undo changes and a lot more.  
Other version control software include: Subversion, CVS, Mercurial.  
They all have a common goal but vary significantly in how they achieve these goals.  
GIT is the most popular version control software/system.

## What Git does for us
- Track changes across files.
- Compare versions of a project.
- Time travel back to older versions.
- Revert to a previous version.
- Collaborate and share changes.
- Combine changes.

## Brief History about Git
In 2005, while working on Linux, [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) became frustrated with the available VCSs, the existing tools were slow, closed-source and usually paid.  
Torvalds wanted a VCS that was fast and free unlike the existing tools.
On April 3rd 2005, he got to work on his own VCS, which would become Git. In a matter of days, he had the most basic functionality done.  
Today, Git is open source, meaning it is developed and maintained by a global community of developers.

## Who uses Git
- Engineers/developers/coders - if you are planning on becoming a software engineer/developer/programmer, then Git is an essential skill to have.
- Tech-Adjacent Roles - designers for example often need basic understanding of Git.
- Governments - drafting laws, sharing data, collaboration in drafting laws, citizens have found typos in those laws and fixed them using Git.
- Scientists also use Git.
- Writers - some writers use Git to manage drafts of complex novels.

## GitHub
GitHub is a web-based platform that provides version control and collaboration tools for software development.  
It allows developers to host, review, and manage code, track changes, and collaborate with others on projects.  
GitHub is built around Git, making it easier for teams to work together and maintain a history of their codebase.
